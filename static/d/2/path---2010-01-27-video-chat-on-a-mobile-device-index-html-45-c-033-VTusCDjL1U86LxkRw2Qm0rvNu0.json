Like the iPhone, iPod, and pretty much every other mobile device, it does not have a front facing video camera to allow video chat. Of course, a certain subset of people really wish it did, and continually whine about said lack. But do you know why it doesn't have video chat?</div> <p></p>\n<div><i>Because video chat on a mobile device just doesn't work.</i></div>\n<p></p>\n<div>Here's how I know: Take your phone. Now, hold it out in front of you in a position that you think would be fitting for a video chat. Keep holding it there, and be steady; no shaking. Keep holding. Try it for just 30 seconds. Is your arm tired yet?</div> <p></p>\n<div>There simply is no way to comfortably hold something like a phone out in front of you without support. You could hold it lower and try to support your arm with your body at the elbow (like a normal phone), but then your chat buddy will get a good look at what is currently up your nose.</div> <p></p>\n<div>The iPad could work with a stand/dock, but in that situation, it's not really <i>mobile</i> is it?</div>\n</div></div></div></div></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Video Chat On a Mobile Device","date":"January 27, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/01/27/video-chat-on-a-mobile-device/index.html/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/01/14/ahhh-a-red-snapper-very-tasty/index.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ahhh, a red snapper.
