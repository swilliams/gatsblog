I did a lot of work in 1.0 and 1.1, and was excited when things like <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172192.aspx\">generics</a> and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/0yw3tz5k.aspx\">anonymous methods</a> showed up in 2.0, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query\">LINQ</a><sup>1</sup> rocked my world (and still does) in 3.5, and more syntactic good stuff in 4. But I often wondered what it would be like for someone new to .NET in 2013. It was easy to learn the new stuff as it came out; it always built on existing technologies and smoothed rough edges. But to jump in without having several years of background? What would that be like?</p></div></div></div>\n<div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 350px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 132.57142857142858%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"\" leaving=\"\" a=\"\" trail\"=\"\" by=\"\" \"las=\"\" -=\"\" initially\"=\"\" on=\"\" flickr.\"=\"\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/9495238eb22c4e9ef3b7d7c2c0fa125d/d45ff/4263948022_2fdefd3f93.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/9495238eb22c4e9ef3b7d7c2c0fa125d/b16f2/4263948022_2fdefd3f93.jpg 148w,\n/static/9495238eb22c4e9ef3b7d7c2c0fa125d/dc3a7/4263948022_2fdefd3f93.jpg 295w,\n/static/9495238eb22c4e9ef3b7d7c2c0fa125d/d45ff/4263948022_2fdefd3f93.jpg 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n</div>\n\t\t\t</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">\t\t&lt;div&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Leaving a Trail&quot; by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/21561428@N03/4263948022/in/photolist-7uMRcd-b6p4Qr-b6p5oe-cnzrTo-948QCJ-dEXL2r-dEXLbF-c6yHFb-c6yHDY-c6yHCj-aSVejM-7YbeAL-aSVeuX-92Yzn4-bpYmH4-d4mkNQ-d4mkmb-ciQ4ZU-8qhCdU-adYqHx-8pSFUK-8DtDWD-dFQwJi-dv2x8q-aBf2MM-8DtDwa-7PPzpG-82Qzh9-hWMGHe-dFApof-88CUdB-99drcu-cHZFtW-cHZKDL-9DUicT-cHZGUj-aDU9T5-dLYbaP-eaVSMJ-edert3-ed8KLv-edeqP9-ed8KHD-eaVTHy-ed8KGe-eaVTiS-eaVTRy-ederxh-edeqHS-eaQgXc-edeqUb&quot;&gt;&quot;las - initially&quot; on flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\t\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></div>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n<div><div><div><div>\n<p>Well, now I know. I had grown kind of tired of .NET after doing it for ten years and needed a change. I decided to make the leap over the summer and focused on <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\">Rails</a> and iOS.</p>\n<p>The most frustrating part of this changeup has been finding work that I want to do. I tried a bit of a moonshot and <a href=\"/words/2013/5/14/fear-of-falling-fear-of-failing-fear-of-rejection\">tried to land a job at Github</a>. I did get an interview and it went pretty well, but they decided to go with someone with more experience in Rails. I don't blame them for that, they probably got dozens (or more) applications from people who had been working with it for years and could hit the ground running. Still was a bit of a bummer though.</p>\n<p>The good news is that I'm having an easier time sliding back into Rails. Web development is mostly the same if you're using curly braces or not. I had done a big project in it a few years ago and all of the paying work I've had since the leap has been with Rails. I've learned how to <a href=\"https://github.com/swilliams/how-to-ride-a-dragon\">write a DSL</a> and shipped some <a href=\"http://rubygems.org/\">gems</a> and other nice things for my clients.</p>\n<p>iOS is a tougher racket. It's has been around for about 5 years, but the underpinnings of it date waaaay back to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT\">NeXT</a> in the 80s. Needless to say there have been quite a few updates to it over the years. Sometimes it feels like drinking from the firehouse to pick things up in it.</p>\n<p>The worst part is that I know I'm missing stuff. When I was developing <a href=\"http://zartbonk.com\">Zartbonk</a>, one of the earlier iterations wasn't working quickly enough to smoothly scroll across the screen. I happened to come across <a href=\"http://www.objc.io/issue-3/moving-pixels-onto-the-screen.html#opaque_vs_transparent\">this section</a> in an <a href=\"http://www.objc.io/\">obc.io</a> article and realized I wasn't setting the <code>opaque</code> property correctly on most of the views in the app. 5 minutes and a few checkboxes later I had a 10% boost in frame rate. It makes me wonder what other low hanging fruit are out there that I've missed.</p>\n<p>That feeling can be demoralizing, but fortunately I know that coding is an iterative process, and there is measurable improvement in my iOS code just over a few months. I just wish I could download the whole Cocoa Touch library to my brain Matrix style.</p>\n\n<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>\n<img src=\"http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/6AOpomu9V6Q/hqdefault.jpg\"><div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<div><div><div><div>\n<p>Since that won&apos;t work, I&apos;ll just keep trucking. My first iOS app is pretty much done (with a few more fixes and features to add). I have a good idea for my second. As the reps increase, so will the quality, and so will the work.</p></div></div></div></div>\n<ol>\n<li>Seriously guys, LINQ is one of the best language features I've seen, ever.</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div></div></div>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Frustrations of the Journeyman","date":"December 02, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013/12/02/the-frustrations-of-the-journeyman/index.html/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/09/19/handling-keyboard-events-with-modifier-keys-in-ios-7/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Handling Bluetooth Keyboard Events With Modifier Keys in iOS 7"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/12/09/stop-thinking-youre-a-special-unicorn/index.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stop Thinking You're a Special Unicorn"}}}}
