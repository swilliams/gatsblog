It looks like an interesting idea, but then I read this <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MicrosoftWebMatrixInContextAndDeployingYourFirstSite.aspx\">tidbit</a>:</div></div>\n<blockquote type=\"cite\">\n<p>Here's how you'd get <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 68, 187);\">WebMatrix</a>...</p>\n<p>Go to the WebMatrix site and click <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 68, 187);\">Download Now</a>. It'll install the Web Platform Install (about 2 megs) and then you click Install. The WebMatrix download for me was 8megs, then SQL Compact was 2.5megs, and then some deployment dependencies brought my total download to 29 megs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div><span>Why can't it just be a single install? And why didn't they just get a normal url instead of <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/?\">http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/?</a> The guy who owns <a href=\"http://www.webmatrix.com\">webmatrix.com</a> hold out for too much money? Based on the current content there, I'd estimate that he'd sell for a sandwich. Maybe have to be a foot-long.</span></div>\n<p></p>\n<div><span>Compare to say, <a href=\"http://panic.com/coda/\">Coda</a>.</span></div>\n<p></p>\n<div><span>It's a good idea; there aren't a whole lot of tools out there that let beginners code in .NET, but I fear that it might be a little too \"Duplo\" for people to want to use. And hopefully Microsoft will do a little more to get it out into the wild than having some devs write about it on Twitter.</span></div>\n</div></div></div></div></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Problem With WebMatrix","date":"July 06, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/07/06/the-problem-with-webmatrix/index.html/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/07/06/why-i-dont-think-i-care-about-pc-gaming-anymo/index.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why I Don't Think I Care About PC Gaming Anymore"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/07/06/webmatrix-a-followup/index.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WebMatrix, a Followup"}}}}
