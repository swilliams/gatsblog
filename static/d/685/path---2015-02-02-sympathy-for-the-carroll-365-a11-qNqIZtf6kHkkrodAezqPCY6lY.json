Maybe they’ll say something silly like <a href=\"http://on.cc.com/1rU1N7O\">“Jedi mind meld”</a>. Everyone in the audience knows exactly what they meant, and everyone will likely make that fact known (I’ve sure been there, and will likely continue to be).</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNq8-4DtvaM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p>Now that I’ve released a few episodes of <a href=\"http://www.fronttoback.co/\">my own podcast</a> I’ve seen the other side of the microphone.

Yeah, he probably should’ve run Marshawn Lynch on that one play, but I don’t know if I would’ve had the brain power to make a different decision with under 30 seconds left, in the 4th quarter, of the Super Bowl. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sympathy for the Carroll","date":"February 03, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2015/02/02/sympathy-for-the-carroll/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015/01/28/podcast-appearances/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Podcast Appearances"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015/02/18/podcast-technology/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Podcast Technology"}}}}
