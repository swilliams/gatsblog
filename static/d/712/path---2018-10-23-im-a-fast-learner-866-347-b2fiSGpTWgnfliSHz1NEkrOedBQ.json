A candidate is nervous about something that I just asked, let’s use <a href=\"https://graphql.org\">GraphQL</a> as an example, about and they’ll say “Well, I don’t know much about GraphQL, but I’m a fast learner!!” and their earnestness nearly jumps out of their body and does a little dance.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing. I hear that phrase <em>all the time</em>. I imagine so does every other hiring manager. And this may sound mean, but so what? If everyone is truly a fast learner, what separates you from the rest? Also, I can probably find someone who already knows GraphQL in the stack of resumes I’m procrastinating in sifting through. What’s my motivation to keep going with you?</p>\n<p>Yeah, that’s definitely harsh, but it’s reality. Hiring managers are usually stressed and need to find the right person very badly. Here’s a way to play to that need and flip the situation. Start with this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wow, it sounds like GraphQL is a bigger deal for this role than I originally thought, and it sounds like I’m a little out of my depth. This still sounds like a dynamite job though, so here’s what I’m going to do: Tonight I’m going to watch the <a href=\"https://egghead.io\">egghead.io</a> series on GraphQL. Then over the next week I’m going to build a little project that consumes the GitHub GraphQL API. I’ll send it to you if you’re still interested. How does that sound?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s a lot better than “I’m a fast learner, please hire me.” It acknowledges the problem (a gap in expectations), and then presents a solid plan for how to overcome it. Further, that candidate shows crazy kinds of initiative, as well as a strong desire for the job, without coming off as begging. And lastly, it’d show me some code, which is very useful when hiring a developer.</p>\n<p>It’s not a guarantee that you’ll get the gig, but will at least impress the interviewer.</p>\n<p>Other things:</p>\n<p>If the job description wasn’t clear about the requirements for GraphQL in the first place… that’s a miss on the hiring manager’s part.</p>\n<p>Also, that response presumes that the candidate has the free-time to do all that, which is not the case for everybody. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I'm a Fast Learner","date":"October 23, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018/10/23/im-a-fast-learner/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018/01/28/book-report-dead-mountain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Report: Dead Mountain"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018/11/01/building-trust-on-teams/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building Trust on Teams"}}}}
