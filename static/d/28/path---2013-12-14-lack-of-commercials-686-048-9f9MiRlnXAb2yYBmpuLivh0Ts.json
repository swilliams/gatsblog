Our oldest daughter was just 3 at the time, so she has almost no knowledge of commercials. A good bi-product of that is her opinions haven’t been swayed toy and fast food advertisers. I don’t think she even knows what a Happy Meal is.</p>\n<p>An unintended side effect is that she doesn’t know how excited she should have been when my wife surprised her with an outing to go see <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Frozen</a> this morning. “What’s that?” she asked, disinterested.
