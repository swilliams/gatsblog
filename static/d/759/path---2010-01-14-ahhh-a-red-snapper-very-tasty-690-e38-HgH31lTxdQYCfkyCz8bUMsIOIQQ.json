We went there last night, and I ordered the Aji sashimi (it's actually a Mackerel, but I just like the title). It came with the body of the fish artfully arranged with the sashimi. The sashimi itself was quite good, however when I was done, the waitress came by, took the plate, and said she was going to \"fry it up\" for me. I wasn't paying that much attention so I just nodded.<p></p>\n<div>After she disappeared to the kitchen I actually processed what she said. Fry up the fish... <i>head</i>? And fins? And tail? Hmmm. Eventually she brought it back, and yes, what was left was definitely deep fried. I girded up my loins and actually ate most of it. Apparently the Aji has soft bones, because I was able to just chomp right on through. That last sentence might be a little squeamish for some folks.</div> <p></p>\n<div>I didn't eat the head (or eyeball) though... as Shawn said, you have to draw the line somewhere.</div> <p></p>\n</div></div></div></div></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ahhh, a red snapper.
