Here was their pitch:</p>\n<p>“We’re going to start delivering you a paper every Wednesday and Sunday. Would you like it in your driveway or on the roof?” and then a pause for laughter. I was more confused; her delivery was pretty bad, and there was a distinct waft of desperation.</p>\n<p>I started to explain that I didn’t want a newspaper even if it was free.</p>\n<p>“But it’s only $.95 per week! You’ll make that up with all the coupons you’ll be getting!” She was pushing the coupons pretty hard. I guess this is why people get newspapers, in order to buy cereal for $.20 off? </p>\n<p>I said I didn’t really care about coupons and politely told them to have a good afternoon. After extricating myself from the conversation I realized something: not once during their pitch did they mention the actual <em>content</em> of the paper. That’s got to be depressing if you’re a journalist — according to your sales staff your work is nothing more than a coupon delivery system with some words in between.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Woe of Newspapers","date":"March 22, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-woe-of-newspapers/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/scotts-guide-to-twitter-happiness/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Scott's Guide to Twitter Happiness"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tracking-down-an-exc-bad-access-with-swift/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tracking Down an EXC_BAD_ACCESS in Swift"}}}}
