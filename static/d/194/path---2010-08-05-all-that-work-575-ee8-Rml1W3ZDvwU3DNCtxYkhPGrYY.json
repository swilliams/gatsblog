One of the great selling points for it is that it will automatically resize images and create thumbnails for them. To do this, it needs the <a href=\"http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php\">ImageMagick</a> library installed.</p>\n<p>No worries, I headed over to their site and saw that the “best” way to install it is via <a href=\"http://www.macports.org/\">mac ports</a>, a package manager similar to <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Apt\">Debian’s apt</a>, but for OS X. </p>\n<p>So I headed over there, and downloaded the 100k installer for that. Only to see that it needed XCode as a dependency, roughly a 1 GB install.</p>\n<p><i>sigh</i></p>\n<p>So, I broke out the system DVD and installed XCode. And then mac ports. And then ImageMagick. Just so that I could resize an image programatically.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"All that work","date":"August 05, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/08/05/all-that-work/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/08/03/whither-windows/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Whither Windows?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/08/06/ui-that-needs-work/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"UI That Needs Work"}}}}
