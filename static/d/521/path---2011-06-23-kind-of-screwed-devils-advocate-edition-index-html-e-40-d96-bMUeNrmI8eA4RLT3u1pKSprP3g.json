Not really my style, but it's very well done. Unfortunately, he has hit a really big legal snag. Jay Maisel, the photographer who took the cover shot of the original album, <a href=\"http://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/\">sued Baio over the altered cover</a> he used. In order to avoid a drawn out and expensive legal battle, Baio settled for $32,500. The Internet has collectively flipped out. <p></p>\n<div>Here's what I wrote on the Hacker News story about it:</div>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"gmail_quote\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;\"> <span>What would the reaction be if, for the sake of argument, EMI took a photo that a small independent photographer made, ran it through what looks like a basic Photoshop filter, and slapped it on the next Coldplay album?
