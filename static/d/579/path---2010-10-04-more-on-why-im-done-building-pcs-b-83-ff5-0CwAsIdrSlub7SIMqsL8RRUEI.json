(Yeah, that’s a computer in your car.) I attempted it when I was 18: it was a bunch of old PC parts inside a Dremeled-out Rubbermaid tub with a gamepad next to my parking brake to control Winamp so I could play MP3s. It was ridiculous. I had to wait until my carputer booted Windows 98 before it could play music. Even I couldn’t take this thing seriously. It lasted about 3 days until I drove over a speed bump and the CPU fell out of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_II\" target=\"_blank\">slot</a>. I scrapped it and just bought an MP3-CD player (the second one ever released) instead.</blockquote> <p></p>\n<div>I have to admit that when I was a little younger, the thought of a <i>carputer</i> was almost irresistible. However I was just never able to cobble together the right kind of parts. I did attempt some other \"questionable\" computer hacks as well; they worked about as good as Marco's.</div> </div></div>\n</div></div></div></div></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"More on Why I'm Done Building PC's","date":"October 04, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/10/04/more-on-why-im-done-building-pcs/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/09/29/android-22s-calculator-app/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Android 2.2's Calculator App"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/11/04/religion-and-signs/index.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Religion and Signs"}}}}
