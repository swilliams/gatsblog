It didn’t have a CD-ROM drive, and didn’t really have a “gaming” sound card, which meant the sounds were primarily bleeps and bloops. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)\">Doom</a> ran if you shrank the screen size down to postage stamp dimensions. I was able to reduce the graphics quality of X-Wing enough to make it playable.</p>\n<p>And play it I did. I didn’t have a joystick, but managed to get along well enough with the mouse<sup>1</sup>. At one point I decided that I would kill every single enemy in the game that was killable. This meant hanging around after missions ended to attack the additional TIE Fighters/Bombers/Interceptors they would send after you to “encourage” you to wrap it up. It also meant attacking the <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/EF76_Nebulon-B_escort_frigate\">Frigates</a> and <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Destroyer\">Star Destroyers</a>, usually by myself. I managed to pull it off in the first campaign but gave up shortly after that. </p>\n<p>At some point I realized that you could have multiple accounts in the game. And those other accounts could be your wingmen in missions. So I took my best pilot, copied it several times over, then added them back to the game so that every wingman I had was at the Top Ace level. </p>\n<p>TIE Fighter was also an important game for me, though by the time I got it (and a computer that would run it) I was getting ready for college and wasn’t as obsessive as only a 14 year old Star Wars fanatic could be. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_xwing_special_edition\">Both</a> <a href=\"http://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_tie_fighter_special_edition\">games</a> are now on sale at gog.com.
