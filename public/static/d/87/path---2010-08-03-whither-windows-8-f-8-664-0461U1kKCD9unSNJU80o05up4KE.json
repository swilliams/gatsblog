It’s the second mac I’ve bought in the last year (the other being an iMac). If myself from five years ago were around, he’d probably be bonking me in the head with a foam rubber bat right now.

I don’t particularly care for it, but you can do that on just about anything. Web apps like Rails/Django/etc? Windows is an afterthought, and often a pain to use. Mobile apps?
