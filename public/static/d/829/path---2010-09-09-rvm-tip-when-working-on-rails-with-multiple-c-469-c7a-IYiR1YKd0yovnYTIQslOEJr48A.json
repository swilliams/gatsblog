But I didn’t want to deal with the issues of having concurrent versions of Rails 2.3.x and 3 running side by side. The word on the street is that <a href=\"http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/\">RVM handles them both well</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/\">RVM itself is relative easy to set up</a>. Although, I should note that trying to run the source-head version (from github) on my laptop caused errors… Running the latest rvm tarball did the trick though. (#2 on that list linked)</p>\n<p>I installed both Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 in RVM, and installed the Rails 3 gem on the 1.9.2 install. Everything went smoothly here.</p>\n<p>Now to sidestep for just a second: I like to have multiple terminal tabs running when developing in Rails. One just runs the local dev server, one will run <a href=\"http://rspec.info/\">autospec</a> (or the Rails console), and another [one or two] is the utility one for running various shell commands.</p>\n<p>So I was in a second terminal tab and wanted to just create a new scaffold with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&amp;gt; rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string</code></pre></div>\n<p>This generated a brand new rails app in a new folder called ‘generate’. What gives? I double and triple checked my syntax to make sure it was correct. It was. I stopped the web server in the other tab and ran the same command there. Bingo, worked like a charm. Argh!</p>\n<p>Finally the light turned on. <em>You need to run RVM in each tab/window. </em>Since RVM is a virtual environment, that state doesn’t persist in different sessions.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&amp;gt; rvm use 1.9.2\n&amp;gt; rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string</code></pre></div>\n<p>Makes sense once you realize what’s going on, but was rather frustrating before that point was reached.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"RVM Tip When Working on Rails With Multiple Consoles","date":"September 09, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/09/09/rvm-tip-when-working-on-rails-with-multiple-c/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/09/03/how-to-use-twilio-to-send-an-sms/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Use Twilio to Send an SMS"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/09/12/it-you-are-not-paying-for-it/index.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"It you are not paying for it..."}}}}
