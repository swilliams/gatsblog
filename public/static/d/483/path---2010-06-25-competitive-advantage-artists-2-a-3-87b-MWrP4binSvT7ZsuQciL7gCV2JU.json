The example provided is that the artist in question turned down a significantly higher salary at a stable job in order to work for the author. Choice quotes:\n<blockquote>\n<p>”[He] is the kind of guy that uses QLab like a musical instrument. I couldn’t keep up with him if I tried. He makes things in QLab I didn’t even know were possible. AND I WROTE IT.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“But for many (all?) of the best people in the world, money stops mattering once you have enough to not worry about it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At least for me, the word “artist” has conotated someone who was tempermental, lazy, and pretentious. And I think that for a large number of so-called “artists” this is true. But I think the true ones are as Chris describes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Artists, as a species, are amazing people… Show me a good artist and I will show you a highly educated, highly creative, highly passionate, highly driven human being.”</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Competitive Advantage: Artists","date":"June 25, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/06/25/competitive-advantage-artists/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/06/25/through-soap-through-soap/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"...through SOAP!
