For starters, it’s much smaller. I love my Nikons, but carrying around a backpack has never been <a href=\"http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/09/04/you-probably-shouldnt-buy-a-dslr/\">convenient</a>, especially when you need to take a shot fast. It can fit in a large pocket, and I have a belt-style pouch for it too. Its lens is fixed at about the equivalent of 35mm on an SLR. You’d think being stuck at a single focal length would be an issue, but it’s a good size for when its use cases (informal portraits, walking around, “street” photography). Oh yeah, and the pictures that come out of it are gorgeous.</p>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/assets/fujifilm/DSCF0026.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>The Desert</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/assets/fujifilm/DSCF0035.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>Prep for a birthday Party</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/assets/fujifilm/DSCF0036.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>Prep for a birthday Party</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Where doesn’t it stand up very well? When you need to get closer. When you need the absolute <em>best</em> image quality. When you need a high frame-rate of shots (sports). I wouldn’t shoot a wedding with just the X100s, but it would be very useful for wandering around during the reception.</p>\n<p>Despite those issues, this is probably my go to camera for 80% of my needs right now. If it had been available 10 years ago when I was considering a DSLR purchase, I might’ve gone with this instead.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fujifilm X100s","date":"June 28, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/fujifilm-x100s/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-i-started-to-understand-model-binding-magic-in-ember/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I Started to Understand Model Binding Magic in Ember"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/friction-and-teams/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Friction and Teams"}}}}
