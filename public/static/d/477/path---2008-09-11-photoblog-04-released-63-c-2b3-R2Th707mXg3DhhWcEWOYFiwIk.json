There are a few behind the scenes stuff that make it easier for me to upload photos, so I should hopefully be updating it more regularly. My backlog is still in spring ‘07 <em>cough</em>. Relevant changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date uploaded is now displayed. My wife showed some confusion over the ordering of the photos. This should clear things up.</li>\n<li>EXIF info is now available for those of you that are interested in that sort of thing. Click on the “info” button to display it.</li>\n<li>Administration functions improved. A file upload control is available rather than manually FTPing the photo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Development is progressing slowly, but surely. It’s not really an ambitious project, but I’ve gotten to know Python and the <a href=\"http://pylonshq.com\">Pylons</a> framework pretty well over the course. Next update will fix a few minor bugs and add more admin functions.</p></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Photoblog 0.4 released","date":"September 11, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008/09/11/photoblog-04-released/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2008/09/08/the-ideal-home-server/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Ideal Home Server"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2008/09/27/svn-report-generator/index.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SVN Report Generator"}}}}
