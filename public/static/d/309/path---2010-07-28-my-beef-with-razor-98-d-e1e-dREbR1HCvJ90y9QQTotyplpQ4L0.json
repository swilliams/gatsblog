This is a good thing, mostly. By default it will be using the brand spanking new <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx\">Razor</a> view engine… and I’m having a hard time trying to figure out why it’s even in there.</p>\n<p>The <i>raison d’être</i> for Razor is to allow for less code in the Views. This too, is a good thing. But I just don’t think it does <i>enough</i>. Here’s one of the samples provided:</p>\n<div>@inherits System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage</div>\n<p></p> <div>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</div>\n<p></p>\n<div>&lt;html&gt;</div> <div>&lt;head&gt;</div>\n<div>\n<span>\t</span>&lt;title&gt;@View.Title&lt;/title&gt;</div> <div>&lt;/head&gt;</div>\n<div>&lt;body&gt;</div>\n<div>\n<span>\t</span>@RenderBody()</div> <div>&lt;/body&gt;</div>\n<div>&lt;/html&gt;</div>\n</div>\n<p>It <i>is</i> nice that you don’t need a gigantic header any more, and I like that the masterpage syntax is a little slimmer, but in general all you’re saving are a bunch of &#x3C;%= %> tags. That’s nice, but is that really that great of an improvement to warrant an entirely new ViewEngine? Am I missing something important here? Especially once you get into non-trivial pages with hundreds of tags and template syntax.</p>\n<p>What I think would have been awesome would be to use the reduced &#x3C;%= %> footprint but also incorporate something like NHaml, which would <i>really</i> minimize the code footprint.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Beef with Razor","date":"July 28, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/07/28/my-beef-with-razor/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/07/27/its-pretty-much-when/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"It's pretty much when..."}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/07/28/prose-i-like-ipad-as-a-hip-flask/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prose I Like: iPad as a hip flask"}}}}
