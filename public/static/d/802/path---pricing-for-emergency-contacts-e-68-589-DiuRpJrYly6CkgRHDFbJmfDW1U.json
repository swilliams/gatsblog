When I was <a href=\"http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/11/06/app-number-2-emergency-contacts/\">developing Emergency Contacts</a>, I knew I had a few options to choose from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free</strong> — The app didn’t take too long to make, but I wasn’t sure that I wanted to just give it away for free. I thought that it had provided a modest amount of utility, so I figured that just straight up free wouldn’t work.</li>\n<li><strong>Free with an In-App Purchase</strong> — I did this with <a href=\"http://zartbonk.com\">Zartbonk</a>. But since the feature set on Emergency Contacts is pretty small, I couldn’t think of what to lock in an extra purchase.</li>\n<li><strong>Free with ads</strong> — I just don’t like ads in apps. I didn’t even look to see how to get this set up.</li>\n<li><strong>Paid</strong> — The choice was really between free and $0.99. Since I had ruled out free, that left me here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Figuring out pricing is hard. I think I made the right choice here, though with a more complex app, I’m not sure if I’d do the same thing.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pricing for Emergency Contacts","date":"November 07, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pricing-for-emergency-contacts/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/app-number-2-emergency-contacts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"App #2 - Emergency Contacts"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/thoughts-on-app-store-beta-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on App Store Beta Review"}}}}
