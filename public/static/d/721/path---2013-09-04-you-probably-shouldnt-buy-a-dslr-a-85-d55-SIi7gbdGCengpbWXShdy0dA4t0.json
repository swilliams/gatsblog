I’ve been an <a href=\"http://swilliamsphoto.com\">amateur photographer</a>, and have taken tens of thousands (if not more) photos of weddings, portraits, and landscapes over the years. I love my photography gear, and even though I don’t use it quite as much as I used to, I’m not going to be changing it any time soon.</p>\n<p>But, with a few exceptions, I don’t think anyone should buy a DSLR anymore.</p>\n<p>DSLRs are big. Like, Orca big. Newer models have been hitting the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXqOZ1JkFFE\">Slim-Fast</a>, but you are never going to be able to fit one in a pocket or purse any time soon. This means you will need a dedicated bag or backpack, which means you won’t be taking it with you, ever. Part of the reason smartphones have replaced point &#x26; shoots is that you always have it with you.</p>\n<p>DSLRs are like gym memberships. People pay lots of money for them, use them for about a month, and then never again.</p>\n<p>Instead, if you really want to drop several hundred dollars on a camera, get a small <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera\">mirrorless</a>. They’re a little bit cheaper, will give you the same quality, and are <strong>much</strong> smaller. If I were starting over today, I’d get one. <a href=\"http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/fuji-x100s-follow-up-review-life-without-dslrs/\">Even some pros are using them for day to day work.</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n    \n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/43bb3b492340b45be821bc9b48b20110/0b9b4/NEXF3KB.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 437px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 64.30205949656751%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"The Sony NEX-F3\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/43bb3b492340b45be821bc9b48b20110/0b9b4/NEXF3KB.png\" srcset=\"/static/43bb3b492340b45be821bc9b48b20110/8d900/NEXF3KB.png 148w,\n/static/43bb3b492340b45be821bc9b48b20110/d8beb/NEXF3KB.png 295w,\n/static/43bb3b492340b45be821bc9b48b20110/0b9b4/NEXF3KB.png 437w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n    <figcaption>The Sony NEX-F2</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Here are some models to check out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00836H2BI/thepetzoo-20\">Sony NEX-F3</a> - <a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-sony-nex-f3-is-our-favorite-affordable-mirrorless-camera-so-far/\">The Wirecutter likes this one</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096WDAIM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0096WDAIM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20\">Olympus E-PM2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DCM0E5Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DCM0E5Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20\">Fujifilm X-M1</a> - A bit pricier</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these are small and light. All of them will take great photos.

Someone who wants to know what f-stops are, how they interact with shutter speeds and ISO. If you just want to take pictures of your kids or pets, then go with one of the mirror-less ones.</p>\n<p>And, by Professional, I mean someone who wants to make money with their camera. For a bunch of reasons not worth getting into, an SLR is probably the right choice for them. Professional doesn’t have to be full-time either (I’m certainly not).</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n1.
