Rails 3 is a big upgrade and change from Rails 2. One of the biggest areas getting a facelift is the routing system.</p>\n<p>In general this <a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html\">guide</a> does a great job explaining everything, but I recently ran into a rather specific wall. By default Rails prefers you to use what they call ”<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST\">RESTful</a> Routes”. I’m rather indifferent to the idea, but I go along with it. This provides you with 7 default routes for a resource. For example, say you create routes for a Model called “Photo”. This will create the following routes (stolen from the aforementioned guide):</p>\n<p>This kind of approach works for 95% of my needs, but sometimes you just need to define something beyond the defaults. Say you need an action called “DoThis”. You can simply modify your Photo route like so:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ruby\"><pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code class=\"language-ruby\">resources <span class=\"token symbol\">:photos</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">do</span>\n  member <span class=\"token keyword\">do</span>\n    get <span class=\"token symbol\">:dothis</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">end</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">end</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>And then <span>/photos/1/dothis</span> will map to a <span>dothis</span> method in your controller. This works as expected, but I needed to submit a form to a custom route as well. So, I just added this to my member do function:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ruby\"><pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code class=\"language-ruby\">post <span class=\"token symbol\">:dothat</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I then attempted to submit a form to the <span>dothat</span> action, but got a Routing Error telling me the route wasn’t found. I double checked and the URL was definitely correct.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ruby\"><pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code class=\"language-ruby\"><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token string\">%= form_for(@photo, :url =</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token symbol\">:controller</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token string\">'photos'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token symbol\">:action</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token string\">'dothat'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">do</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span>f<span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>It generated the correct URL: <span>photos/1/dothat</span>, which I confirmed by calling rake routes at the command line.</p>\n<p>After searching the Interent and only getting frustrated I finally saw <a href=\"http://asciicasts.com/episodes/203-routing-in-rails-3\">something</a> that jogged my memory.</p>\n<p>In REST, ‘post’ is for <em>creating</em> new resources.
