I had a bit of cash running around and decided to buy a spare iPod Touch to install the beta.</p>\n<p>I went to the Apple store and asked to purchase a <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/\">32 GB black model</a>. I chatted with the clerk for a bit and told him it was only going to be a development device. He mentioned that the <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_touch_16gb\">16 GB version</a> was available too. I had thought that the 16 GB was last year’s model with the 3.5” screen still hanging around to hit the $229 price point. He replied that it had been recently updated with the newer tech, just no camera, less RAM, and so on. Since I didn’t need those for my particular purposes, I just bought that one.</p>\n<p>How many other stores would talk a customer out of $70? Contrast this to Best Buy and I’d be out of an extra $70 and have to deal with a hard sale for a case, warranty, and accessories. This is why Apple retail  can’t be underestimated.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quality Customer Service","date":"June 12, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013/06/12/quality-customer-service/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/06/07/incentivization/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Incentivization"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/06/18/multiplane/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Multiplane"}}}}
