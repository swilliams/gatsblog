Thus, I have become very familiar with the after-meal mint. Not all mints are created equal; there are some that are simply better than others. As a service to you, I have ranked them in ascending order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, there are the hard-peppermint-candy-cane mints. These are the most common, and while they are a little better than having your breath smell like chimichangas, they aren’t memorable. Some places have the ones that are green and brown, which provide a slightly better experience, but still aren’t worth writing home about.</li>\n<li>Slightly better than those guys are the fruity cylindrical mints (for lack of a better name). I will usually grab a couple of these and mix flavors. My favorites are blue and red, though I usually tire of sucking on them after a little while.</li>\n<li>Next, are what I believe are called “pillow” mints, because they look like pillows. In my experience, I have found these most often at Chick-fil-a’s. They are tasty, and remind me a little like chewable Tylenols from when I was kid<sup>1</sup>. The only downside is that after eating them, they turn into a sticky paste that binds to my teeth for the next ten minutes.</li>\n<li>Finally, we come to the king. Andes mints. If a server brings a few of these guys to the table along with the check, he automatically qualifies for a nice tip. “I’m sorry that the waiter spilled the clam chowder all over your dress, honey, but he brought Andes mints; that’s gotta be at least 15%.” One time I was leaving a place and passed the server station. There was an open and unguarded box of Andes mints sitting right there. Let’s just say I had to spend a little extra time in the gym the following day and leave it at that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are the things that I feel I should share about my travels.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I may or may not have faked headaches when I was a kid to eat more chewable Tylenols. I liked the flavor. I have no regrets.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Minty Fresh","date":"March 18, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2010/03/18/minty-fresh/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/02/11/snoooow/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Snoooow"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010/03/22/the-long-path-to-a-new-phone/index.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Long Path to a New Phone"}}}}
