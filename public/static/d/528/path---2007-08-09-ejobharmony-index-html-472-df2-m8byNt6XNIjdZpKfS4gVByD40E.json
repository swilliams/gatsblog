One of the biggest barriers that kept me from diving in sooner was that it is such a pain to find a new job. Aside from having to switch over insurance companies, retirement accounts, etc. there’s the whole searching business which can just be annoying.</p>\n<p>And then I realized that the process of finding a job is very similar to the dating game. You have “friends” that can hook you up with a “nice” gig (“they have a great personality!”), <a href=\"http://jobs.joelonsoftware.com/\">personals</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.azdes.gov/esa/events.asp\" title=\"Job Fairs\">meat markets</a>. Heck, you even have pimps (some may call them <em>contractors</em>).</p>\n<p>In the dating world, some companies have realized just how hit and miss most of those are and started evaluating personality. I personally have never used a place like <a href=\"http://www.eharmony.com\">eharmony</a>, but I am familiar with the psychology behind their processes.<sup><a href=\"#27_1\">1</a></sup> And, apparently they have had a pretty <a href=\"http://www.eharmony.com/static/newsletter/volume36.htm\">decent success rate</a>.</p>\n<p>It makes me wonder if the same thing could work in the job market. What if one of the larger job sites like <a href=\"http://www.dice.com\">dice.com</a> listed not only the job requirements, but also had a candidate fill out a basic personality profile? Yes, people could just lie on the profile, but they can already do that their resumes too. It would make me feel a little more comfortable going in to a new situation knowing that I was going to fit in with my co-workers.</p>\n<p><a></a>1.
