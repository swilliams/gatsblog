Not really my style, but it’s very well done. Unfortunately, he has hit a really big legal snag. Jay Maisel, the photographer who took the cover shot of the original album, <a href=\"http://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/\">sued Baio over the altered cover</a> he used. In order to avoid a drawn out and expensive legal battle, Baio settled for $32,500. The Internet has collectively flipped out. </p>\n<p>Here’s what I wrote on the Hacker News story about it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What would the reaction be if, for the sake of argument, EMI took a photo that a small independent photographer made, ran it through what looks like a basic Photoshop filter, and slapped it on the next Coldplay album? Internet outrage right?\nAnd then what would happen if the photographer sued EMI and Coldplay, and won a $32K settlement? I’m guessing the Internet would either be satisfied or angry that $32K is too little for such deep pockets.\nI understand and agree that Jay was too vicious in this, but how is he in the wrong again?</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kind of Screwed - Devil's Advocate Edition","date":"June 23, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2011/06/23/kind-of-screwed-devils-advocate-edition/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011/05/19/i-got-your-airprint-right-here/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I Got Your AirPrint Right Here"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011/07/14/spotify-rdio/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spotify & Rdio"}}}}
