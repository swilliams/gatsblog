The current one doesn’t display entirely properly in Internet Explorer, and I’m not sold on the color scheme. <a href=\"http://www.markmacleod.com\">Mark</a> probably has the best theme going for his blog, but I can’t just go out and copy now could I?</p>\n<p>As for what I’ll actually be posting here, I think I have an idea. I’m tired of talking about techie things, and most everyone else beats me to the punch anyway. I think I may just use this as a repository for my creativity. I’ve been writing some stuff for my church’s high school ministry, and found the process to be very enjoyable, so I may just see how long I can go with it. Off the top of my head I think I’ll have bits of prose, scripts, and photos. I hate poetry (both reading and writing) so you can be sure I won’t subject anyone to that nonsense.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A direction","date":"July 24, 2006"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2006/07/24/a-direction/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/07/21/new-bloggy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Bloggy"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/07/24/interns-038-pirates/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Interns &#038; Pirates"}}}}
