I just turned in my resignation to my current employer and will be starting my new role in a couple of weeks with <a href=\"http://www.sogeti.com\">Sogeti</a>. I won’t go into the sordid details of why I’m leaving, but will say that the primary reason is that I feel I’ve reached the limit of where my current employer can take me career-wise.</p>\n<p>My job will be a kind of blend between the stable world of salary-based pay, and contract-like change of scenery. Sogeti consults for many large clients and sends small teams of developers to either develop solutions or augment existing teams.</p>\n<p>So, I’m a little nervous, but also excited. I hope this works out.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A change","date":"August 08, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007/08/08/a-change/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/07/21/its-a-girl/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"It's a girl!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/08/09/ejobharmony/index.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"eJobHarmony?"}}}}
