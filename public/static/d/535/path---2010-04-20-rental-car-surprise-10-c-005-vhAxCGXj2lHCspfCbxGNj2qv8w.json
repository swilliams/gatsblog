I didn’t enjoy driving it, so when I returned it, I told them that while I’m open to the idea of them upgrading my mid-size rental, I’d prefer something other than a gigantic truck.</p>\n<p>Cut to Sunday night as I wandered over to the parking spot that contained my car for this week. Behold, it contained… another F150. <i>sigh</i>. I trudged back over to the rental counter and explained to the nice chap explained the whole thing again. I just didn’t want something that would be featured in a Cialis ad.</p>\n<p>The Avis employee was effusively gracious, apologized to me, and looked through his computer for an adequate substitute. I was expecting to be banished back to the realm of Hyundai econoboxes, when he said, “Let me see if I can get you into one of our Infinitis.”</p>\n<p>Cool.</p>\n<p>I stared at him for a couple of moments and eventually managed, “Yes. That would be nice.” </p>\n<p>So that’s how I got to spend the next couple of days driving around in a nice little <a href=\"http://www.infinitiusa.com/g_sedan/\">G37 sedan</a>.
