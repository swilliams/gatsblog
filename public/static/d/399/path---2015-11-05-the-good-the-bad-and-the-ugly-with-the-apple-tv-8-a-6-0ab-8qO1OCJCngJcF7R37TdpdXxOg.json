So to get to all the DVDs and Blu-rays I’ve ripped I have to use the same UI as the old Apple TV.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Siri doesn’t work with Music.

This has already been discussed at length everywhere. One thought I had would be that it’d be cool to enter passwords via Siri. Y’know, like that one scene in TNG:</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oNrWgjh9tnU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>\n<p>(A Touch ID powered remote would probably be better)</p>\n<p>App discoverability. It’s really bad, and I don’t know how they’re going to fix it. Top Charts was just added, which is better than nothing, but if someone wants to market their app anywhere online they have no way to provide a link to it! “Go to the app store, search for s-o-m-e-t-h-i…” is all kinds of awful.</p>\n<p>Overall I like it.
