I had ordered the King of Steaks, a Rib-Eye medium rare and was looking forward to eating it. When I cut into my steak I saw that it was basically well-done (there was the tiniest sliver of pink left amidst a sea of gray). I flagged the server and said “Um, I ordered this medium-rare…”<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Without a moment’s hesitation she apologized, grabbed the plate and went directly back to the kitchen with it.

She checked back again a few minutes later to make sure everything was ok (it was).</p>\n<p>Why was this so good? She knew exactly what had happened and knew how to fix it to my satisfaction. There weren’t any games played, just immediate and decisive action.</p>\n<p>I was at a hotel recently and the last day something bad happened that left a sour taste in my mouth. The manager on duty very nice and apologetic. But she asked “What would you like me to do to ‘make it right’?“. I hate that question because I don’t know how to respond.

There could've been a dozen reasons why my steak was overcooked, and it probably wasn't the server's fault, so there's no use in getting angry with her about it. The best part is that I didn't even have time to get angry.\n</small></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Best Customer Service","date":"October 15, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2014/10/15/the-best-customer-service/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014/09/10/thoughts-on-swift/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on Swift"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014/10/28/x-wing-nostalgia/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"X-Wing Nostalgia"}}}}
