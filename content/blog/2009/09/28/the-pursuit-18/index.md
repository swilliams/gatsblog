I've posted a couple of quotes recently that on the surface seem to be a little depressing. However, it's quotes like these that motivate me. I <i>want</i> to be the best that I can at photography. Thus, I'll read and soak up as much information as I can regarding it. Unfortunately, I don't have a steady stream of people willing to be photographed, so when I do get the itch, I'll end up doing a semi-dorky self-portrait.

Most importantly, when I am doing a picture of someone else, I want to take the absolute best picture in my whole life, and feel disappointment if at the end of the day I haven't produced that.
