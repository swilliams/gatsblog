In the same vein of applying <a href="http://swilliams.posterous.com/your-photos-are-boring">harsh self criticism</a>:

> Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.
-- Calvin Coolidge
