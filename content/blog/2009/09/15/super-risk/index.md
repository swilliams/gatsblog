You know what would be an amazing iPhone app?

* Take a long turn based strategy game likeÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)">Risk</a>.
* When you turn on multi-player have it detect your location.
* Have it find people near you. Near enough for a Bluetooth connection to work (say in an office).
* Join up in a game with everyone around you via Bluetooth.
* Have updates be sent via Push Notifications when it is your turn, or when you are being attacked.

This would be a pretty great way to get through a work day (or week).
