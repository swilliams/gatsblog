<div><div><div><div><div>I was looking for a replace sync cord for one of my <a href="http://www.alienbees.com">Alien Bee</a> triggers, and noticed this fantastic piece of usability on their website. Mouse over the <a href="http://www.alienbees.com/cords.html">SC-CST, CSSC, and SC-CSTAUX</a> images to see a close up of the ends of the cords. This lets you see exactly what kind of plug it is, which helps since I usually don't remember the semi-esoteric names that various cables use, and a picture taken from 10 feet away doesn't display this detail.</div></div></div></div></div>
