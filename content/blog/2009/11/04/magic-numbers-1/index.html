<div><div><div><div><div>In programming, it is generally a good idea to avoid "magic numbers" meaning a number that could change with requirements:<p></p>
<div>if (foo &lt; 3) { do something }</div> <p></p>
<div>That 3 could change, or it's meaning could be lost. A good practice is to define a variable for that magic number with an intelligent name (and possibly store the number in some configuration).</div> <p></p>
<div>const int maxWidgets = 3;</div>
<div>if (foo &lt; maxWidgets) { do something }<p></p> </div>
<div>I did recently see a bit of code that got the concept, but failed in the execution:</div>
<p></p>
<div>const int THREE = 3;</div> <div>if (foo &lt; THREE) { do something }</div>
<p></p>
<div>It is possible that the maximum number of widgets might change to 10. Then you're stuck with this brilliant bit of code:</div> <p></p>
<div>const int THREE = 10;</div>
<p></p>
<div>Uh oh.Â </div>
</div></div></div></div></div>
