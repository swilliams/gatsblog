<div><div><div><div><div>I think I might want to print up some business cards for my <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com">photography</a>. I sketched out some basic designs today and will scan them in later (perhaps tonight). I was originally thinking of using some sort of aperture for a logo, but I think a simplified camera "shape" would work better.</div></div></div></div></div>
