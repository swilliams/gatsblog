My contract with T-Mobile is up in a couple of months, and I've been looking at the HTC Hero (on Sprint) as a replacement. I saw this review on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SUO6YDMKIJ5/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">Amazon</a>:

> The Hero is very adaptable. For example, I have a variety of home screens set up on my phone... but I also downloaded... a Star Trek soundboard, so now whenever I get it a text Worf says 'Captain, incoming message.'

Yeah, I'm going to count that as a con.
