Our first full day here and it snowed in the morning. These were shot out my hotel window on the iPhone so excuse the lack of quality.

I had thought that Dallas had about the same weather as Phoenix, though apparently it is a wee bit different. This morning was clear, and even colder. This weekend I will be purchasing some more cold weather clothing, including a longer coat.
