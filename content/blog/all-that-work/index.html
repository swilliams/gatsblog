<div><div><div><div><div>I'm using the awesome <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> plugin in my <a href="swilliams">rails app</a>. One of the great selling points for it is that it will automatically resize images and create thumbnails for them. To do this, it needs the <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> library installed.<p></p>
<div>No worries, I headed over to their site and saw that the "best" way to install it is via <a href="http://www.macports.org/">mac ports</a>, a package manager similar to <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Apt">Debian's apt</a>, but for OS X. </div>
<p></p>
<div>So I headed over there, and downloaded the 100k installer for that. Only to see that it needed XCode as a dependency, roughly a 1 GB install.</div>
<p></p>
<div><i>sigh</i></div>
<p></p>
<div>So, I broke out the system DVD and installed XCode. And then mac ports. And then ImageMagick. Just so that I could resize an image programatically. </div>
