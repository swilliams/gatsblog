<p>I really enjoy the flavor that sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives together and wanted to do something crispy with them. The first time I made this, I didn't add the feta, or salt the tortillas. It was still pretty good, but the feta sealed the deal.</p> <p>I considered using flatbread instead of tortillas, but I think that would be too thick. Some fresh basil might be good as a garnish too, I'll try that in the future.</p> <p>And considering I made this up as I went, the measurings are probably inaccurate, use your own discretion.</p> <p>Ingredients, 1 serving:</p> <ul>
<li>2 T Diced Shallots (or onions)  </li>
<li>1 T Sun Dried Tomatoes, diced  </li>
<li>1 T Kalamata Olives, diced  </li>
<li>1 Clove Garlic, diced  </li>
<li>2 T butter or olive oil  </li>
<li>2 T Canola Oil  </li>
<li>2 Tortillas (I prefer the "raw" ones that need to be cooked)  </li>
<li>1/4 Cup Shrimp, chopped  </li>
<li>1 T Lemon Juice  </li>
<li>1 T White Wine  </li>
<li>2 T Feta cheese  </li>
<li>Salt for taste</li>
</ul>
<p>Put shrimp in glass bowl and add lemon juice and wine.</p> <p>Cook up the tortillas (if needed) and set aside.</p> <p>Melt butter and saute shallots for several minutes over Medium heat. Add tomatoes and olives and continue to saute. Add some white wine to deglaze pan if needed.</p> <p>Add garlic and shrimp. Cook for a couple of minutes until shrimp is done.</p> <p>In a clean pan, add canola oil and a small pinch of salt. Turn heat up to medium high. Rub a small amount of salt onto the tortilla. Place one tortilla in pan and add the shrimp/olive/tomato mixture. Add feta cheese and cover with the other tortilla. Brown each side to make it crispy. Remove to plate, and cut into quarters.</p>
