<div><div><div><div><div>My contract with T-Mobile is up in a couple of months, and I've been looking at the HTC Hero (on Sprint) as a replacement. I saw this review on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R32SUO6YDMKIJ5/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">Amazon</a>:<p></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> "The Hero is very adaptable. For example, I have a variety of home screens set up on my phone... but I also downloaded... a Star Trek soundboard, so now whenever I get it a text Worf says 'Captain, incoming message.' "</blockquote> <p></p>
