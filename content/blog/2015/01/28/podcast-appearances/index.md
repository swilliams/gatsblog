Podcasts are Important Business. Here's an update.

### Better Know a Jackal
The [rabid] fans of the 5by5 podcast network are informally known as "Jackals". One of said Jackals, [Mike Beasterfeld](http://twitter.com/mikebeasterfeld) had the brilliant idea to create a [podcast to interview us](http://www.jackals.us/better-know-a-jackal). I made it onto [episode 28](http://www.jackals.us/better-know-a-jackal/28). It's a nice little bio that you can use to gather information to steal my identity.

### Less Than Or Equal
I was a guest on episode 25 of [Aleen Simms's](http://twitter.com/aleen) [Less Than Or Equal](http://www.lessthanorequal.com/episodes/25) podcast. I had a great time talking with her and we chatted about maturity, growing up, and how having daughters changed me; specifically some specific incidents in my personal history that formed me into what I am today. Speaking of daughters...

### Front to Back
We just released our [6th(!) episode](http://www.fronttoback.co/podcast/2015/1/27/6-practice-kid). I've really enjoyed making this show and have learned more and more about audio editing. This time around I used some [compression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression) to make our voices sound better.
