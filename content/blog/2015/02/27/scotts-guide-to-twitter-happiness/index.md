1. You don't *have* to be on Twitter every 2 minutes. If there's a meme you don't like, a perfectly valid option is to put your phone away.
2. Silliness is good. Everything doesn't have to be all doom and gloom serious all the time.
3. Change takes time, and is often the result of a succession of small steps with a few medium ones here and there. Be happy when the small steps happen.
4. Find some joy.

Is that a little reductive? Sure. But if you find yourself feeling angrier and angrier over what happens on Twitter, it might be time to reconsider how you're using it.
