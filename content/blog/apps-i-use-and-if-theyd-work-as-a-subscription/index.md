Apps on my home screen that I use most often and my opinion if they'd be appropriate for the [new subscription service Apple is rolling out](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/whats-new/).

* [Heartwatch](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/heartwatch.-view-get-notified/id1062745479?mt=8) — probably not
* [Runkeeper](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/runkeeper-gps-running-walk/id300235330?mt=8) — already has a [separate subscription service](https://runkeeper.com/go?utm_campaign=gogeneral&utm_medium=web&pchannel=web.mark.nav&utm_source=homepage)
* [Human](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/human-activity-tracker-walking/id692721875?mt=8) — already has a separate subscription service
* [Addapp Insights](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/addapp-insights/id893111432?mt=8) — if they beefed their analysis up, maybe
* [Activity++](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/activity++/id1089666978?mt=8) — no
* [Pedometer++](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pedometer++/id712286167?mt=8) — no
* [Fantastical](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-ipad-calendar/id830708155?mt=8) — no
* [Carrot Weather](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-talking-forecast/id961390574?mt=8) — no
* [Simplenote](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/simplenote/id289429962?mt=8) — had a [separate subscription service](https://simplenote.com/premium/), but it's on hold for now. I bet this news will change that.
* [Unread](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/unread-rss-news-reader/id911364254?mt=8) — piggyback's onto other subscription services, but doesn't have its own built-in
* [1Password](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8) — already has a [family](https://1password.com/families/) or [organization](https://1password.com/teams/) plan
* [Spark](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-love-your-email-again/id997102246?mt=8) — no
* [MyFitnessPal](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-diet-tracker/id341232718?mt=8) — already has a [separate subscription service](http://blog.myfitnesspal.com/introducing-myfitnesspal-upgrade/)
* [Paprika](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/paprika-recipe-manager-for/id406732590?mt=8) — yes, though they already provide a sync service free of charge (via iCloud perhaps?)
* [Day One](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-2-diary-+-journal/id1044867788?mt=8) — yes, though they already provide a sync service free of charge
* [Tweetbot](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-4-for-twitter/id1018355599?mt=8) — not with the current feature set
* [Overcast](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8) — I'm betting [Marco](https://marco.org/) is already working on integrating the subscription system into Overcast.

I wonder how many, if any, will consider switching an existing subscription service to one built into Apple's systems. I wonder how many, if any, companies will [rush](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/04/06/textexpander-6-and-textexpander-com/) into subscription without really thinking it through and angering all their users. There are a whole lot of economic factors at play to consider before doing that.
