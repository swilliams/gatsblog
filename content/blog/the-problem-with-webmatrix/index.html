<div><div>Microsoft released a new [beta] product called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/">WebMatrix</a>. It looks like an interesting idea, but then I read this <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MicrosoftWebMatrixInContextAndDeployingYourFirstSite.aspx">tidbit</a>:</div></div>
<blockquote type="cite">
<p>Here's how you'd get <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">WebMatrix</a>...</p>
<p>Go to the WebMatrix site and click <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">Download Now</a>. It'll install the Web Platform Install (about 2 megs) and then you click Install. The WebMatrix download for me was 8megs, then SQL Compact was 2.5megs, and then some deployment dependencies brought my total download to 29 megs.</p>

<div><span>Why can't it just be a single install? And why didn't they just get a normal url instead of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/?">http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/?</a> The guy who owns <a href="http://www.webmatrix.com">webmatrix.com</a> hold out for too much money? Based on the current content there, I'd estimate that he'd sell for a sandwich. Maybe have to be a foot-long.</span></div>
<p></p>
<div><span>Compare to say, <a href="http://panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>.</span></div>
<p></p>
<div><span>It's a good idea; there aren't a whole lot of tools out there that let beginners code in .NET, but I fear that it might be a little too "Duplo" for people to want to use. And hopefully Microsoft will do a little more to get it out into the wild than having some devs write about it on Twitter.</span></div>
