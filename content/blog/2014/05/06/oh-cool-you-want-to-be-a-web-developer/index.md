Just go and learn any or all of these:

* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
* [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)
* [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
* [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)

This list is not exhaustive. Some of those are optional. By the time you are done reading this, another framework or library will have been created.

This is a [frustration](http://blog.swilliams.me/2013/12/02/the-frustrations-of-the-journeyman/) that I feel with web development these days. I spent about 2 years learning [one](http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/) client-side framework inside and out, but it's already losing relevance. Angular seems to be a good choice for employment these days, but if I go deep in it, will history repeat itself?
