In [Part 1](/2014/01/09/my-computers-through-the-ages) I talked about my first few computers. They were an important part of my childhood, and shaped the person I would become and the career I chose. When I went to college I started to build and upgrade my own PCs. Things went well enough at first, but then got a little out of hand.

###Dark Ages

**Custom PC #1** (2000) Since I was still in college, I didn't have very much money and bought some dirt cheap parts from websites that may have been run by questionable companies. These parts were leftover from [OEMs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oem) and didn't have real retail boxes. Some would just show up with a minimal layer of bubble wrap around the bare hardware. I had bought a [Pentium III CPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_iii), but screwed up putting the heatsink on it. It was too unstable to run at its advertised speed, so I had to *underclock* it or it'd just lock up the whole system within minutes. It could run [Quake 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena) well enough though at that speed.

**Custom PC #2** (2001) If at first you don't succeed right? This was the only time I strayed away from the Intel and bought an [AMD Athlon processor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd_athlon). I had learned from my mistake and assembled it correctly, but it also had problems and would lock up at odd times. I remember trying to show my parents just what a computer could do by playing an assortment of Led Zeppelin mp3s, and halfway through Stairway it froze and needed to be restarted. I was either not a very good PC builder or kept buying crummy parts. Probably a little from column A and a little from column B.

I hit the nadir of my computer history while putting this computer together. During the assembly I saw that there were some weird red splotches on the inside of the case but couldn't figure out what they were. More started to appear and then I realized that I had cut my hand on a sharp hunk of metal from the bargain basement case and I was bleeding all over it.

###Working Stiff

**Custom PC #3** (2004) I had a real jobby-job and was earning more than the $Nothing I was in college, so I was finally able to afford computer parts that came in actual boxes, and wouldn't require keeping a roll of bandages nearby. I went back to Intel and got a [Pentium 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_IV) to run [Windows XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_xp). This was my first DIY computer that actually ran ok. It was also the first time I used an LCD monitor. The [19" Dell Ultrasharp](http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/dell-ultrasharp-1905fp/4505-3174_7-31232074.html) was a big upgrade to the cumbersome CRTs I had been using.

**Custom PC #4** (2007) My last Windows PC, and also the best. My brother-in-law worked at Intel and as "payment" for taking some pictures at his wedding gave me a nice [Core 2 Duo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_2_duo#Core_2_Duo) CPU. The prior one worked well enough, but was very loud. Pentium 4's were known to run hot, and my case required a number of fans to keep mine from melting through to the Earth's core. The Core 2 Duo was much quieter. 

Honestly, there wasn't anything very memorable about this one. It was a Camry — reliable, but otherwise unremarkable. 

Things were starting to change for me. I had been a software developer working in the [Microsoft stack](https://msdn.microsoft.com/) for a long time and felt a seven year itch to move on to different things.


###Fruit
I never liked Apple computers. When I was growing up in the early-mid 90s, it was the "dark" times for Apple, when they kept releasing unremarkable computers with ancient notions of software. Even when Steve Jobs returned,  I thought of them as too expensive and fluffed up with a bunch of annoying marketing. I especially despised the original iMac<sup>1</sup> with the [goofy colors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83nS4EGKU04), [awful mouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_USB_Mouse), and thought that it was dead in the water because it lacked a floppy drive. This wouldn't be the first time a technical prediction of mine was hilariously off base.

As time went on I did start to like the industrial design of a few models. The original [Titanium Powerbooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4#Titanium_PowerBook_G4) (so thin!), and the [G4 Cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4_cube) looked especially nice to my eyes, but they were still way too expensive for my budget.

Around the time they switched over to Intel processors I started to reconsider my position. I liked that they were [Unixy](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/SystemTechnology.html), making certain kinds of web development easier. Eventually, some of the more garish designs of OS X were [stripped back](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/3/), and I decided to make the leap.

Apple recently celebrated the [30th anniversary of the original Macintosh](http://www.apple.com/30-years/). I joined the Mac train in 2009, and have [mostly] liked it ever since. Next time I'll go into the specifics of the Macs that I've owned, and why I recommend them.
