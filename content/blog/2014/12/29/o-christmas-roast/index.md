O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Thy rawness shall be ending<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Thy rawness shall be ending<br />

Inside the oven you shall go<br />
So that the juice within you flows<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Thy rawness shall be ending<br />

O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Such gravy will you make me!<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Such gravy will you make me!<br />

The thermometer will pierce your side<br />
Until your temp reads 125<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Such gravy will you make me!<br />

O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
We'll set our teeth upon thee!<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
We'll set our teeth upon thee!<br />

Two yards of plastic will we turn<br />
To avoid a chilling freezer burn<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
We'll save you for another meal<br />

Each tasty bite<br />
Each dab of meat<br />
No other bite will fill my cheeks<br />

O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Within our guts digesting<br />
Within our guts digesting<br />
