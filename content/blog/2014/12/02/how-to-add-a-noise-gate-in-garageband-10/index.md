GarageBand is a decent amateur audio editor and is also free. I use it to edit [my podcast](http://fronttoback.co), which has worked out ok. 

Dealing with audio buzzing or humming can be a problem. Sometimes this can be [headphone bleed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spill_%28audio%29), or ambient noise, or anything. A [noise gate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_gate) can fix that up pretty well if it isn't too loud<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. What a noise gate does is analyze your audio and mutes any sound that is below a certain volume. GarageBand has this built-in but it is a little hard to find. It's interface has changed over different versions, so googling around for it often yields out of date information. Here is where it is in version **10**.

First click this knobby button.

This'll bring up a panel at the bottom with some additional controls. Click the information "i" button, turn off "Master", and click "Controls" from the segmented control.

Finally, you'll have a checkbox labeled "Noise Gate" in that info side panel. Check it to turn it on, and use the slider to adjust how big of a gate you want.

This will set the gate on the *entire* track that is selected up in the main UI. You can have different gates for different tracks, but I don't think you can different ones on a single track in GarageBand.

Once I scrape together a little more cash I might go out and get [Logic Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/logic-pro-x/id634148309?mt=12&uo=4&at=11lxUn). For now though, GarageBand works well enough.
