Family is cool and all, but really, the reason we have holidays in AMERICA is to eat too much. Here's how they rank. This is not opinion, it is fact.

<ol>
<li><strong>Thanksgiving</strong>. Turkey. We do it two ways, the traditional bake, and also a smoked one. Dressing/Stuffing. Potatoes. Pies (never have just one). Everything else. Part of the romanticism for Thanksgiving is also everything that goes with it: family (I happen to like mine), friends, football, cool weather, cooking, showing my kids how to cook. Leftovers are critical: More turkey, turkey soup, turkey sandwiches, more potatoes and stuffing. Here's how much we love Thanksgiving in the Williams house: we make a second Thanksgiving meal before Christmas. Speaking of:</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Christmas</strong>. Roast beef (garlic + rosemary). More potatoes. More Pie. Pudding.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Memorial Day/Independence Day/Labor Day</strong>. From a meal perspective, these are pretty much the same. Grill and/or barbecue. Beer. Diversity amongst the meat is good.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Octoberfest</strong>. Bratwurst on crusty rolls with sauerkraut and super grainy mustard. Beer. No it's not a "real" holiday, congratulations on pointing that one out. You're a regular Columbo, you are.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="50">
<li><strong>Easter</strong>. Ham. I like various pig derived food products, but baked ham just isn't as good. Eggs are fine and I eat them all the time, but it's hard to make them extra "special". How often do you cook a turkey for 8 hours during the year? Compare that to eggs.</li>
</ol>

Once again, the logic here is flawless. No conjecture. For realsies.
