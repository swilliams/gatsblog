Pricing is tricky for mobile apps these days. When I was [developing Emergency Contacts](http://blog.swilliams.me/2014/11/06/app-number-2-emergency-contacts/), I knew I had a few options to choose from:

* **Free** — The app didn't take too long to make, but I wasn't sure that I wanted to just give it away for free. I thought that it had provided a modest amount of utility, so I figured that just straight up free wouldn't work.
* **Free with an In-App Purchase** — I did this with [Zartbonk](http://zartbonk.com). But since the feature set on Emergency Contacts is pretty small, I couldn't think of what to lock in an extra purchase.
* **Free with ads** — I just don't like ads in apps. I didn't even look to see how to get this set up.
* **Paid** — The choice was really between free and $0.99. Since I had ruled out free, that left me here.

Figuring out pricing is hard. I think I made the right choice here, though with a more complex app, I'm not sure if I'd do the same thing.
