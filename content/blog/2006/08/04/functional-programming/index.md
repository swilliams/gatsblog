In the interest of furthering my knowledge of Ye Olde Computer Science, I've taken a slight interest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Programming" title="Wikipedia definition (boring)">Functional Programming</a>. For the neophyte, this is a different paradigm than what is generally standard programming, mostly relegated to boring university papers and phd students. However, it can have some benefit in the real world, and I'm a proponent of "knowing more" rather than "knowing less."
