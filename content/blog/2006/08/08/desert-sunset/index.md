Still no <a href="http://www.krazyyak.com/2006/07/30/cloudy-desert/">super duper monsoons</a>, but this was sort of close. I was originally planning on driving up to the Pinnacle Peak area for a few sunset pictures, but found a little dirt road on my way that overwhelmed my curiousity.

There was a bunch of garbage littered around, allowing for some cool things, but as the sun went down the clouds turned this color. Five minutes either way and it wasn't nearly as impressive.
