<img alt="Not sure exactly what this building is. It looks like some kind of quarry elevator thing. I've had my eye on it for a while, the lighting works quite well when it's dark out, but it was hard to find a good position to get in for the shot. It's gated pretty much all the way around. Fortunately I found a little gap between a couple of trees on a nearby street. It's a good thing God created telephoto lenses.
