I'm still not settled on a theme for this site. The current one doesn't display entirely properly in Internet Explorer, and I'm not sold on the color scheme. <a href="http://www.markmacleod.com">Mark</a> probably has the best theme going for his blog, but I can't just go out and copy now could I?

As for what I'll actually be posting here, I think I have an idea. I'm tired of talking about techie things, and most everyone else beats me to the punch anyway. I think I may just use this as a repository for my creativity. I've been writing some stuff for my church's high school ministry, and found the process to be very enjoyable, so I may just see how long I can go with it. Off the top of my head I think I'll have bits of prose, scripts, and photos. I hate poetry (both reading and writing) so you can be sure I won't subject anyone to that nonsense.
