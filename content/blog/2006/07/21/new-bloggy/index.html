<div><div><div><div><div>Long time readers are probably noticing that everything is different! That is because I have switched hosting companies from <a href="http://www.exabytes.com" title="ExaBytes" target="_blank">exabytes</a>, over to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com" title="Dreamhost" target="_blank">dreamhost</a>. The catch is that dreamhost only runs Linux web servers, so I can't directly import stuff from my old blog. I will see about getting all that taken care of though.
