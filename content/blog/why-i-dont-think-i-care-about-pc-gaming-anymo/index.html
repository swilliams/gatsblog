<div><div><div><div><div>To play top of the line games on a PC and have enjoyable performance, I would need:<div>
<ul>
<li>A pretty fast processor, upgraded about every 18 months. $200-$400</li>
<li>A good amount of memory, upgraded about every 2-3 years. $150-$300</li> <li>A <b>very</b> good video card, likely upgraded every year for best framerates. $500</li>
<li>Optionally, a nice sound card and speaker set up. $200-$400, though it doesn't need to upgraded often, if ever.</li>
<li>A gigantic amount of patience to deal with drivers, DRM, compatability, and every other niggling thing that goes with a PC. (Ask me some time about getting a basic microphone to work with Teamspeak.</li> </ul>
<div>Or, I could buy a game console:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul><li>XBox 360. $300ish. </li></ul>
<div>Yeah, you have to pay a monthly fee for XBox Live, but it'll still be <i>far</i> less expensive than the upgrade treadmill that PC gaming is. The tradeoff is well worth it in my opinion.</div> </div>
<p></p>
<div><span>Ok, obviously things aren't really this cut and dry, but for all intents and purposes, these estimations are pretty accurate.</span></div>
