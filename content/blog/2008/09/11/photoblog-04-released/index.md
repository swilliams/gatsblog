I've deployed the latest version of my <a href="http://photo.krazyyak.com">Photoblog</a>, 0.4.0. There are a few behind the scenes stuff that make it easier for me to upload photos, so I should hopefully be updating it more regularly. My backlog is still in spring '07 *cough*. Relevant changes:

* Date uploaded is now displayed. My wife showed some confusion over the ordering of the photos. This should clear things up.
* EXIF info is now available for those of you that are interested in that sort of thing. Click on the "info" button to display it.
* Administration functions improved. A file upload control is available rather than manually FTPing the photo.

Development is progressing slowly, but surely. It's not really an ambitious project, but I've gotten to know Python and the <a href="http://pylonshq.com">Pylons</a> framework pretty well over the course. Next update will fix a few minor bugs and add more admin functions.</p>
