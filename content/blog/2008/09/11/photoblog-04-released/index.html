<p>I've deployed the latest version of my <a href="http://photo.krazyyak.com">Photoblog</a>, 0.4.0. There are a few behind the scenes stuff that make it easier for me to upload photos, so I should hopefully be updating it more regularly. My backlog is still in spring '07 *cough*. Relevant changes:</p> <ul>
<li>Date uploaded is now displayed. My wife showed some confusion over the ordering of the photos. This should clear things up.</li> <li>EXIF info is now available for those of you that are interested in that sort of thing. Click on the "info" button to display it.</li> <li>Administration functions improved. A file upload control is available rather than manually FTPing the photo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Development is progressing slowly, but surely. It's not really an ambitious project, but I've gotten to know Python and the <a href="http://pylonshq.com">Pylons</a> framework pretty well over the course. Next update will fix a few minor bugs and add more admin functions.</p>
