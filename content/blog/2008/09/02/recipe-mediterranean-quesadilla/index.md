I really enjoy the flavor that sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives together and wanted to do something crispy with them. The first time I made this, I didn't add the feta, or salt the tortillas. It was still pretty good, but the feta sealed the deal.

I considered using flatbread instead of tortillas, but I think that would be too thick. Some fresh basil might be good as a garnish too, I'll try that in the future.

And considering I made this up as I went, the measurings are probably inaccurate, use your own discretion.

Ingredients, 1 serving:
* 2 T Diced Shallots (or onions)  
* 1 T Sun Dried Tomatoes, diced  
* 1 T Kalamata Olives, diced  
* 1 Clove Garlic, diced  
* 2 T butter or olive oil  
* 2 T Canola Oil  
* 2 Tortillas (I prefer the "raw" ones that need to be cooked)  
* 1/4 Cup Shrimp, chopped  
* 1 T Lemon Juice  
* 1 T White Wine  
* 2 T Feta cheese  
* Salt for taste

Put shrimp in glass bowl and add lemon juice and wine.

Cook up the tortillas (if needed) and set aside.

Melt butter and saute shallots for several minutes over Medium heat. Add tomatoes and olives and continue to saute. Add some white wine to deglaze pan if needed.

Add garlic and shrimp. Cook for a couple of minutes until shrimp is done.

In a clean pan, add canola oil and a small pinch of salt. Turn heat up to medium high. Rub a small amount of salt onto the tortilla. Place one tortilla in pan and add the shrimp/olive/tomato mixture. Add feta cheese and cover with the other tortilla. Brown each side to make it crispy. Remove to plate, and cut into quarters.
