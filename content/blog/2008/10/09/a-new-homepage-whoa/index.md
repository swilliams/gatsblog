Nobody thought I could ever do it. I had a really lame, "Coming Soon" placeholder that pointed to the <a href="swilliams">blog</a> and <a href="http://photo.krazyyak.com">photo blog</a> for months. Yet I finally got some stuff together and created a radical <a href="http://krazyyak.com">homepage/portal</a> thing for all my stuff.

There's still plenty of work to be done, and lots of stuff isn't finished yet, but I figured it was still alright to publish.

It aggregates all the blogs I maintain (personal, photo, <a href="http://www.sogeti-phoenix.com/Blogs/author/swilliams.aspx">work</a>), and will soon list all of the stuff I do on Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and more.
