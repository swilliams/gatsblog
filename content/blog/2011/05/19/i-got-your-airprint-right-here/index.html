Step 1 Install DropBox. If you don't already use DropBox, there's something wrong with you, and you need to sign up with my affiliate link so I can get more space. Step 2 Create a folder in DropBox.

Right click the folder, select the DropBox menu and click &quot;Share This Folder...&quot; follow the instructions there. Step 3 (Advanced) Create an AppleScript that watches a folder and then prints whatever gets added to it. I borrowed this script and made a gist of it on github. Step 4 Save your script to: Macintosh HD &gt; Library &gt; Scripts &gt; Folder Action Scripts. I called mine: &quot;custom - print folder&quot; Step 5 Right click on your To Print folder on your computer, and click &quot;Folder Action Setup...&quot; This'll open a multicolumn window and then a modal dialog. Find your script in the list and click &quot;Attach&quot;. Make sure the &quot;Enable Folder Actions&quot; checkbox is checked too, and close the dialog. Here's the final result: Bingo! Now, anything that is placed in that folder will be printed. And since it is tied in to DropBox, you can do this from anywhere. Now, if I want to frighten my wife, I can create a threatening document on my iPad at a coffee shop and print it from there!" src="./1305860605000.jpg">
