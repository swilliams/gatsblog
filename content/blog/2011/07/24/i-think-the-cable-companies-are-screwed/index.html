<div><div><div><div><div>I just ordered two Roku boxes for our house. We have a Netflix Instant subscription, and will likely be converting our Hulu Plus trial into a full subscription as well. Once they arrive we will likely be killing our cable TV service. And if there's a random show that doesn't pop up on either of those, iTunes can fill it in. We are currently paying somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 per month for cable, and both of those subscriptions run $8 each, so we should be saving a decent chunk of money each month. <p></p> The only things I will be missing will be live sporting events, which I watch less and less, and can always go to a bar or wherever. <p></p> I have no idea how long this will last, and I do wonder if both Netflix and Hulu can continue to offer such a low rate for their services.</div></div></div></div></div>
