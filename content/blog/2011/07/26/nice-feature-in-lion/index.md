Actually, this may have preceded Lion, but I rarely use Safari so I don't know. 

My Internet connection died (thanks Cox!). Opened a page in Safari and got the "Safari can't connect to the Internet" screen. Rebooted router. When connection was re-established, the page I was trying to reach was automatically reloaded and popped up while I was going through my Instapaper queue. Nice job, whoever implemented that.
