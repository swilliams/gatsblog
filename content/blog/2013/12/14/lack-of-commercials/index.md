<a href="/words/i-think-the-cable-companies-are-screwed">We cut our cable a couple of years ago</a> and have been using Netflix/Hulu/iTunes as our primary source of television ever since. Our oldest daughter was just 3 at the time, so she has almost no knowledge of commercials. A good bi-product of that is her opinions haven't been swayed toy and fast food advertisers. I don't think she even knows what a Happy Meal is.

An unintended side effect is that she doesn't know how excited she should have been when my wife surprised her with an outing to go see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Frozen</a> this morning. “What's that?” she asked, disinterested. Fortunately, once she was told there was a princess in it she was much more excited<sup>1</sup>.

I suspect this will change as she makes her way through grade school and her friends start talking about toys and things like that, but for now it's nice.
