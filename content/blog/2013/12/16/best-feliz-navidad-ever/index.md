<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feliz_Navidad_(song)">Feliz Navidad</a> is a terrible song, and you should play it whenever possible to harass your friends into submission.

One of my favorite podcasts, <a href="http://5by5.tv/incomparable">The Incomparable</a>, opened <a href="http://5by5.tv/incomparable/173">episode 173</a> with this masterpiece. When I heard it, I knew it would be even better as a ringtone, so here we are.

Listen to it here, or download it <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/392461/best-feliz-navidad.m4r">directly as a ringtone</a>.
