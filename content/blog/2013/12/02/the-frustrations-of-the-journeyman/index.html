<div><div><div><p>I was a .NET programmer from almost the beginning. I did a lot of work in 1.0 and 1.1, and was excited when things like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172192.aspx">generics</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/0yw3tz5k.aspx">anonymous methods</a> showed up in 2.0, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">LINQ</a><sup>1</sup> rocked my world (and still does) in 3.5, and more syntactic good stuff in 4. But I often wondered what it would be like for someone new to .NET in 2013. It was easy to learn the new stuff as it came out; it always built on existing technologies and smoothed rough edges. But to jump in without having several years of background? What would that be like?</p></div></div></div>

<p>Well, now I know. I had grown kind of tired of .NET after doing it for ten years and needed a change. I decided to make the leap over the summer and focused on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and iOS.</p>

<p>The most frustrating part of this changeup has been finding work that I want to do. I tried a bit of a moonshot and <a href="/words/2013/5/14/fear-of-falling-fear-of-failing-fear-of-rejection">tried to land a job at Github</a>. I did get an interview and it went pretty well, but they decided to go with someone with more experience in Rails. I don't blame them for that, they probably got dozens (or more) applications from people who had been working with it for years and could hit the ground running. Still was a bit of a bummer though.</p>

<p>The good news is that I'm having an easier time sliding back into Rails. Web development is mostly the same if you're using curly braces or not. I had done a big project in it a few years ago and all of the paying work I've had since the leap has been with Rails. I've learned how to <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/how-to-ride-a-dragon">write a DSL</a> and shipped some <a href="http://rubygems.org/">gems</a> and other nice things for my clients.</p>

<p>iOS is a tougher racket. It's has been around for about 5 years, but the underpinnings of it date waaaay back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> in the 80s. Needless to say there have been quite a few updates to it over the years. Sometimes it feels like drinking from the firehouse to pick things up in it.</p>

<p>The worst part is that I know I'm missing stuff. When I was developing <a href="http://zartbonk.com">Zartbonk</a>, one of the earlier iterations wasn't working quickly enough to smoothly scroll across the screen. I happened to come across <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-3/moving-pixels-onto-the-screen.html#opaque_vs_transparent">this section</a> in an <a href="http://www.objc.io/">obc.io</a> article and realized I wasn't setting the <code>opaque</code> property correctly on most of the views in the app. 5 minutes and a few checkboxes later I had a 10% boost in frame rate. It makes me wonder what other low hanging fruit are out there that I've missed.</p>

<p>That feeling can be demoralizing, but fortunately I know that coding is an iterative process, and there is measurable improvement in my iOS code just over a few months. I just wish I could download the whole Cocoa Touch library to my brain Matrix style.</p>

<p>Since that won't work, I'll just keep trucking. My first iOS app is pretty much done (with a few more fixes and features to add). I have a good idea for my second. As the reps increase, so will the quality, and so will the work.</p>

<li>Seriously guys, LINQ is one of the best language features I've seen, ever.</li>
