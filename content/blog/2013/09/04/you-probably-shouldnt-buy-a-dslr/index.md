I have three digital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera">SLR</a> cameras<sup>1</sup>, and a bunch of nice lenses to go with them. I've been an <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com">amateur photographer</a>, and have taken tens of thousands (if not more) photos of weddings, portraits, and landscapes over the years. I love my photography gear, and even though I don't use it quite as much as I used to, I'm not going to be changing it any time soon.

But, with a few exceptions, I don't think anyone should buy a DSLR anymore.

DSLRs are big. Like, Orca big. Newer models have been hitting the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXqOZ1JkFFE">Slim-Fast</a>, but you are never going to be able to fit one in a pocket or purse any time soon. This means you will need a dedicated bag or backpack, which means you won't be taking it with you, ever. Part of the reason smartphones have replaced point &amp; shoots is that you always have it with you.

DSLRs are like gym memberships. People pay lots of money for them, use them for about a month, and then never again.

Instead, if you really want to drop several hundred dollars on a camera, get a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera">mirrorless</a>. They're a little bit cheaper, will give you the same quality, and are <strong>much</strong> smaller. If I were starting over today, I'd get one. <a href="http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/fuji-x100s-follow-up-review-life-without-dslrs/">Even some pros are using them for day to day work.</a>.

Here are some models to check out:

All of these are small and light. All of them will take great photos. And, you might actually take it with you.

###Exceptions

Here are the two people who should probably stick with DSLRs: the Student and the Professional. 

By Student I mean someone who wants to *learn* photography. Someone who wants to know what f-stops are, how they interact with shutter speeds and ISO. If you just want to take pictures of your kids or pets, then go with one of the mirror-less ones.

And, by Professional, I mean someone who wants to make money with their camera. For a bunch of reasons not worth getting into, an SLR is probably the right choice for them. Professional doesn't have to be full-time either (I'm certainly not).
