<p>My oldest has been naming her stuffed animals and finally came to her stick horse. She's been partial to "Alley" and named a bunch of other ones that. This time around I think she wanted to change it up a bit. I'm guessing she heard the name "Malik" and combined those into "Alik". At least I think that's how it goes. </p>

<p>So, like any good parent I asked her a few questions about the newly christened Alik. </p>

<p>"Where did you take Alik this morning?"</p>

<p>"Did you take Alik somewhere with your friends?"</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take Alik tomorrow?"</p>

<p>And so on. </p>
