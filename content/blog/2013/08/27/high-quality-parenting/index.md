My oldest has been naming her stuffed animals and finally came to her stick horse. She's been partial to "Alley" and named a bunch of other ones that. This time around I think she wanted to change it up a bit. I'm guessing she heard the name "Malik" and combined those into "Alik". At least I think that's how it goes.

So, like any good parent I asked her a few questions about the newly christened Alik.

"Where did you take Alik this morning?"

"Did you take Alik somewhere with your friends?"

"Where are you going to take Alik tomorrow?"

And so on.
