50 Years ago this happened.

Non-violence is one of the things I admire the most about Martin Luther King, Jr. It's crazy when you think about it. It goes against human nature. The first thing that pops into my mind when I am wronged is vengeance or "getting back". Now, imagine having hundreds of years of oppression against you and people who look like you. I'd be seething with anger. And yet, here's this man saying "Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred." Just amazing.
