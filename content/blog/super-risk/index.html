<div><div><div><div><div>You know what would be an amazing iPhone app? <ul class="MailOutline">
<li>Take a long turn based strategy game like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)">Risk</a>. </li>
<li>When you turn on multi-player have it detect your location.</li>
<li>Have it find people near you. Near enough for a Bluetooth connection to work (say in an office).</li>
<li>Join up in a game with everyone around you via Bluetooth.</li>
<li>Have updates be sent via Push Notifications when it is your turn, or when you are being attacked.</li>
</ul>
<div>This would be a pretty great way to get through a work day (or week).</div>
