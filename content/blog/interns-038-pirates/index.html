<div><div><div><div><div>My church's high school group has been putting out a few <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/">The Office</a> inspired videos based on the lives of the three interns.Â Our next Summer Camp is going to be Pirate themed.Â So, it was decided to try to incorporate the two. I don't have it finished, but here is a what I have thus far.

If you aren't familiar with it there are a few main characters:
<ul>
<li>Goz - the high school pastor; the aloof big boss. This is the first time he'll be in the videos.</li>
	<li>Jason - the director, very much a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Bill Lumbergh</a> boss.</li>
	<li>Brad - The intern that's been around for the longest.</li>
	<li>Chris - Another intern.</li>
	<li>Coco - The youngest and newest intern. I was channelling <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0136797/">Steve Carell's character from Anchorman</a> for him - kind of dim, but nice.</li>
</ul>
