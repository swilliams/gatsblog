<div>From a Hacker News <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1489142">discussion</a> on this <a href="http://www.aaronstannard.com/post/2010/07/03/NET-Culture-Shock-Why-NET-Adoption-Lags-Among-Startups.aspx">topic</a>: </div>
<br><blockquote type="cite"><span><a href="http://ASP.Net">ASP.Net</a> controls, postbacks for everything, view state, a general hiding of the actual power of ajax and an obsession with using tables made .Net a terrible web development environment if you had any clue what you were doing.</span></blockquote>
<br><div>That kind of sums up how I felt about WebForms. They worked fine in certain situations, but it really felt like a bunch of crap built on top of simple web programming to get the Internet to feel like VB 6.</div>
