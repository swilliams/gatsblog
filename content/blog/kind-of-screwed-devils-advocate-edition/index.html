<div><div><div><div><div>Andy Baio's 8-bit version of Miles Davis's seminal album is pretty interesting. Not really my style, but it's very well done. Unfortunately, he has hit a really big legal snag. Jay Maisel, the photographer who took the cover shot of the original album, <a href="http://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/">sued Baio over the altered cover</a> he used. In order to avoid a drawn out and expensive legal battle, Baio settled for $32,500. The Internet has collectively flipped out. <p></p>
<div>Here's what I wrote on the Hacker News story about it:</div>

Internet outrage right?</span> </blockquote> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;">  </blockquote>

I'm guessing the Internet would either be satisfied or angry that $32K is too little for such deep pockets.  </blockquote> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;">  </blockquote>
