<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> Ever build a carputer? (Yeah, that’s a computer in your car.) I attempted it when I was 18: it was a bunch of old PC parts inside a Dremeled-out Rubbermaid tub with a gamepad next to my parking brake to control Winamp so I could play MP3s. It was ridiculous. I had to wait until my carputer booted Windows 98 before it could play music. Even I couldn’t take this thing seriously. It lasted about 3 days until I drove over a speed bump and the CPU fell out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_II" target="_blank">slot</a>. I scrapped it and just bought an MP3-CD player (the second one ever released) instead.</blockquote> <p></p>
<div>I have to admit that when I was a little younger, the thought of a <i>carputer</i> was almost irresistible. However I was just never able to cobble together the right kind of parts. I did attempt some other "questionable" computer hacks as well; they worked about as good as Marco's.</div> </div></div>
