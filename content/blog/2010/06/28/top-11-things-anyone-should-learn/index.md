Found this via <a href="http://twitter.com/strobist/status/17300967582">Strobist's twitter feed</a>, it was meant for photographers, but I think it applies to just about every profession that requires some semblance of creativity.

Perhaps my favorite bit from it:

> "It is about the ability to sustain, to weather the storms, to shoot poorly and still survive a job, to fight out of inevitable creative slumps, to live with all manner of risk that lots of folks would find uncomfortable, to make uncertainty your friend, and to thrive despite sudden curves and happenstance. I guess what I'm describing is tenacity. To love doing this so much that you'll go through 1000 "no's" just to hear the one 'yes.'"<b> - Joe McNally</b>
