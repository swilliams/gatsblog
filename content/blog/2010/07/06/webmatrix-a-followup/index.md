Regarding my <a href="./1278464100000.jpg">last post</a>, one Microsoft's big problems is that the only people who really see their new .NET utilities and apps are the ones that already Microsoft-centric shops.

It looks like WebMatrix is aiming for outside the typical boundaries, trying to catch people who might otherwise go to LAMP, Rails, Django, or wherever else. 

Don't get me wrong, I actually <i>like</i> .NET, it's just that I don't know if this will end up being the next FrontPage.
