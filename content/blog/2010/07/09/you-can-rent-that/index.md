> The average price of a casket alone is $2,000 and can run upwards of $10,000 for a really nice one. Rather than spending that kind of money, rent a casket for the service at a few hundred bucks and later transfer the departed into something more economical for burial. They're not going to know the difference, anyway.

I didn't even know you could <i>rent</i>Â a casket. Still, a coffee can is probably cheaper.
