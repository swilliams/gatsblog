From Paul Graham's latest essay,Â <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html">"The Acceleration of Addictiveness"</a>

> Several people have told me they like the iPad because it lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would be too conspicuous. In other words, it's a hip flask.

The whole essay is worth a read, though that footnote is probably my favorite.
