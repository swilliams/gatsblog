I was pretty bummed when <a href="http://twitter.com/swilliams/status/13131780209">Apple killed Lala</a>. I do have a sliver of hope that they did it because they were launching their own version of a cloud based music app, but it is only slightly larger than the hope that I'll wake up one day and be able to shoot lightning from my fists.

Fortunately, even if they don't, it looks like <i><a href="goog_732771196">Google</a></i><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/20/um-did-google-just-quietly-launch-a-web-based-itunes-competitor-yep/"> will</a>. Money quote:</div> 

> Gundotra also announced that Google recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/20/google-buys-simplify-media-to-power-music-syncing-for-new-itunes-competitor/">made an aquisition</a>: Simplify Media. Using this technology, Google will soon offer a desktop app that will give you access to all of your (DRM-free) media on your Android devices remotely.<br></span>

Now, if they would just make a music playing app on Android that was worth a crap.
