<div><div><div><div><div>I was pretty bummed when <a href="http://twitter.com/swilliams/status/13131780209">Apple killed Lala</a>. I do have a sliver of hope that they did it because they were launching their own version of a cloud based music app, but it is only slightly larger than the hope that I'll wake up one day and be able to shoot lightning from my fists. <p></p>
<div>Fortunately, even if they don't, it looks like <i><a href="goog_732771196">Google</a></i><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/20/um-did-google-just-quietly-launch-a-web-based-itunes-competitor-yep/"> will</a>. Money quote:</div> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> <span>Gundotra also announced that Google recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/20/google-buys-simplify-media-to-power-music-syncing-for-new-itunes-competitor/">made an aquisition</a>: Simplify Media. Using this technology, Google will soon offer a desktop app that will give you access to all of your (DRM-free) media on your Android devices remotely.<br></span>

<div>Now, if they would just make a music playing app on Android that was worth a crap.</div>
