This is bordering on email forward territory, but it's my blog and if you don't like it, go play in the traffic.

> “Which programming language should I learn first?”
> Depends.
> To program in an expressive and powerful language: Python
> To get a website up quickly: <span>PHP</span>
> To mingle with programmers who call themselves “rockstars”: Ruby.
> To really learn to program: C.
> To achieve enlightenment: Scheme.
> To feel depressed: SQL
> To drop a chromosome: Microsoft Visual Basic
> To get a guaranteed, mediocre, but well paying job writing financial applications in a cubicle under fluorescent lights: Java.
> To do the same thing with certifications and letters after your name: C#
> To achieve a magical sense of childlike wonder that you have a hard time differentiating from megalomania: Objective C
> 
> I could go on… but I’m not feeling hateful enough today.
