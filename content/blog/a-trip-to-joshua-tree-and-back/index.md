*[Editor's note: the author will try not to make any terrible [U2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joshua_Tree) jokes, but no guarantees, k?]*

On drive back from visiting my grandfather in Palm Springs, I started to notice a few interesting spots right off of I-10. I got to thinking that even though I've driven that stretch of road dozens of times I've never seen what's just down the various exits. When I got home I asked a friend if he wanted to go with me on an adventure, we set a date and went off.

I decided that I didn't have enough stress on my wallet and rented an amazing [Nikon D800](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LAJQVR6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00LAJQVR6&linkCode=as2&tag=thepetzoo-20&linkId=SXRLLGQXQE6EXCZV) with a [lens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037KM0X0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0037KM0X0&linkCode=as2&tag=thepetzoo-20&linkId=WKK5Q3JEYBRTBVUG) to go with it.

I was blown away by the [dynamic range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range) of the D800. I thought I'd appreciate the step in quality over my older D300, but wow! I haven't had the opportunity to use a [medium format setup](http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/why-i-moved-to-medium-format-phase-one-iq140-review/), but I think I understand just how much of a jump in quality a larger sensor size can make.

Anyways, here's our journey.

### Salome Rd, North off I-10

    <figcaption>Some kind of utility shed off of Salome Rd</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Cactus" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1313.jpg">
    <figcaption>I'm not totally sold on the value of having a maximum aperture of f/1.4 on a 24mm lens, but this cactus demonstrates that it can look pretty. Also further down Salome Rd, then Eagle Eye Rd.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Out Past Blythe
<figure>
    <img alt="No Hunting" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1343.jpg">
    <figcaption>Blythe is a town that people usually stop in for lunch on their way to California or Arizona. We decided to see what's out on the roads that go beyond the fast food.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Rusted Car" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1370.jpg">
    <figcaption>According to Apple Maps, Lovekin Rd is supposed to go all the way up to Highway 62. I'm sure it does, but at about 3/4's of the way it becomes a private road and is no longer paved. This rusted out hulk was about 100 yards away from the end.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Storm and Desert Center
<figure>
    <img alt="Storm Comin'" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1374.jpg">
    <figcaption>Back on I-10. We saw a big weather system moving in and managed to get onto an overpass before it hit us.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Decay" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1383.jpg">
    <figcaption><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Center,_California">Desert Center</a> is what gave me the idea to do this trip in the first place. Most of the town looks abandoned, and yields some pretty interesting photo locations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Family Cafe" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1392.jpg">
    <figcaption>It was pouring at this point, but I did manage to run out in the rain long enough to grab this.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Old Gas Pump" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1402.jpg">
    <figcaption>Next to the caf√© was an ancient gas station. Each of the pumps were in various stages of decay.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Chevron Supreme" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1410.jpg">
    <figcaption>Chevron Supreme!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Squatted" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1423.jpg">
    <figcaption>A little west of of the cafe was a group of pre-fabricated houses, kind of like what you'd see from Habitat for Humanity. All of them were basically destroyed from neglect and looked like a refuge for squatters.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Tagged" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1428.jpg">
    <figcaption>All of them were vandalized too.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Desert" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1432.jpg">
    <figcaption>To escape the weather we headed north from Desert Center up Highway 177. In the distance you could see the dust blowing against the mountains.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Joshua Tree Park
I finally found what I was looking for. *[ed. [Argh!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EabB55IYyOg) You were warned.]*

<figure>
    <img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1464.jpg">
    <figcaption>Joshua Trees are interesting. They look like palms trees, but with multiple heads.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1473.jpg">
    <figcaption>This is the Dynamic Range I was talking about. The sun is literally right behind the tree, but you can still make out plenty of detail in the shadows.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Fat caterpillar" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1505.jpg">
    <figcaption>We also found lot's of fat caterpillars. This guy looked like he was getting ready to do the chrysalis thing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Jumbo Rocks" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1515.jpg">
    <figcaption>If you like bouldering or climbing rocks, this would be the place for you. After this trip, I want to return and camp there to be able to explore all of its crannies.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1522.jpg">
    <figcaption>By this point I was coming up with various schemes to justify keeping the D800.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1530.jpg">
    <figcaption>Yup.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Coming Home
<figure>
    <img alt="My Scion" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1545.jpg">
    <figcaption>We drove <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/04/20/in-which-i-purchased-a-new-car/">my car</a> The way out of the park back down to I-10 was filled corners and S-curves. Needless to say, I loved it.</figcaption>
