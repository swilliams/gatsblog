<p>I usually don't like to commentate on tech news; there are more than enough people doing that already. Let's just let this be a freebie and be done with it, K?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/23/4651536/who-will-be-the-next-microsoft-ceo">Steve Ballmer is retiring from Microsoft within the next year.</a> People are quick to call him out as a "terrible" CEO. I think terrible is a little harsh. I wouldn't call him "great" or maybe even "good". Probably just "average" instead.</p>

<p>Under his watch, profits and revenues went up significantly<sup>1</sup>, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/20/with-19b-in-revenue-microsofts-server-and-tools-chief-says-hes-just-getting-started-interview/">their enterprise market grew into a success</a>, and the Xbox became a household name.</p>

<p>But I think he'll be remembered most of all for all the things that Microsoft squandered or was caught flat-footed for.</p>

<ul>
<li>Music. Microsoft introduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plays_for_sure">PlaysForSure</a> and then replaced it with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune">Zune</a> as Apple was gearing up to launch the iPhone.</li>
<li>Mobile. After having a headstart and early lead, the iPhone and Android just whalloped them.</li>
<li>Mobile, again. Tablets are a huge market. Microsoft just took a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/07/18/microsoft-takes-900-million-writeoff-on-struggling-surface-tablet/">$900M write-off on theirs</a>, and <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/windows/microsoft-news/microsoft-surface-rt-price-slashed-150/240158217">reduced prices to try to induce demand</a>. This after having a "tablet" on the market in 2005. </li>
<li>Search. Social.</li>
<li>Online docs. They could still pull this one out though. </li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft's MO has always been to let others establish a market, then enter it and dominate. Under Gates that worked well for them, but under Ballmer things moved too quickly for that strategy. With few exceptions, that never changed.</p>

<p>Ballmer ultimately did better than some other tech CEOs of his time (Jonathan Schwartz, Carly Fiorina, LÃ©o Apotheker, most Yahoo CEOs), but the unrealized potential and missed opportunities will be his legacy. He did an Ok job all things considered, but Microsoft needs a CEO better than Ok. </p>

<li>
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23815563">The company has more than tripled revenues and doubled profits under Mr Ballmer's leadership.</a> </li>
