Why you shouldn't be too outlandish in the garbage text you create when debugging an email script: there may be someone else in the company that has the same name as you, and only a '.' differentiates the address. The "other" Scott Williams was cool about it though. Fortunately I didn't fill the body of the email with random profanities or compromising pictures of myself.
