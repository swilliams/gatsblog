It is generally a Bad Thing<sup>tm</sup> when I am presented with a dialog from a <a href="http://www.krazyyak.com/category/tfs/">source control management system</a> and am not sure which button to click that will <em>not</em> destroy all of the changes I have made. Especially when there is no option to branch/shelve these changes just in case I do something stupid.
