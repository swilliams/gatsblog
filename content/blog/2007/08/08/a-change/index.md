Well, I'm off on another new job adventure! I just turned in my resignation to my current employer and will be starting my new role in a couple of weeks with <a href="http://www.sogeti.com">Sogeti</a>. I won't go into the sordid details of why I'm leaving, but will say that the primary reason is that I feel I've reached the limit of where my current employer can take me career-wise.

My job will be a kind of blend between the stable world of salary-based pay, and contract-like change of scenery. Sogeti consults for many large clients and sends small teams of developers to either develop solutions or augment existing teams.

So, I'm a little nervous, but also excited. I hope this works out.
