Before I <a href="http://www.krazyyak.com/2007/08/08/a-change/">turned in my resignation</a> I had been considering seeking new employment for a while. One of the biggest barriers that kept me from diving in sooner was that it is such a pain to find a new job. Aside from having to switch over insurance companies, retirement accounts, etc. there's the whole searching business which can just be annoying.

And then I realized that the process of finding a job is very similar to the dating game. You have "friends" that can hook you up with a "nice" gig ("they have a great personality!"), <a href="http://jobs.joelonsoftware.com/">personals</a>, and <a href="http://www.azdes.gov/esa/events.asp" title="Job Fairs">meat markets</a>. Heck, you even have pimps (some may call them <em>contractors</em>).

In the dating world, some companies have realized just how hit and miss most of those are and started evaluating personality. I personally have never used a place like <a href="http://www.eharmony.com">eharmony</a>, but I am familiar with the psychology behind their processes.<sup><a href="#27_1">1</a></sup> And, apparently they have had a pretty <a href="http://www.eharmony.com/static/newsletter/volume36.htm">decent success rate</a>.

It makes me wonder if the same thing could work in the job market. What if one of the larger job sites like <a href="http://www.dice.com">dice.com</a> listed not only the job requirements, but also had a candidate fill out a basic personality profile? Yes, people could just lie on the profile, but they can already do that their resumes too. It would make me feel a little more comfortable going in to a new situation knowing that I was going to fit in with my co-workers.
