<p>This is what my desk looked like about a week ago:<br></p>
<p>
As my wife can attest, I had become a little disgruntled with the whole thing, since there wasn't any extra space to actually do anything. So, I did something about it:<br><br>

I got a small shelf thing from IKEA and put the monitors and laptop on top of it, freeing up a ton of space. I use <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/">Synergy</a> to allow me to use the same mouse and keyboard on both the desktop and laptop. I still need to work on the wiring a bit to make it extra pretty, but I definitely enjoy it more.
