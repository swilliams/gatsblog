<p>Apparently, the cat is out of the bag. Certain <a href="http://www.maltastar.com/pages/msFullArt.asp?an=14323">Wikipedia articles may be edited by people to include their own bias</a>! Amazing, I know. However, this news does not really change my opinion of wikipedia. I still think it is a fantastic resource and incredibly useful when I need to get the basic gist of some random topic that grabs my interest.

Fortunately for me, I have the luxury of not having to do any sort of research that requires concrete evidence. In other words, I am not a student with a paper due. However, the idea that the stuff I read may not be entirely kosher is a little worrisome. There is a relatively simple solution though: references. A good wikipedia article cites the sources of the "facts" it portrays.

What I gain from this is that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Ball" title="Q-Ball">article</a> in question is probably pretty sound. And if I still feel that something is fishy, I can actually look those references up(!). Additionally, I can verify that the sources are not just some guy's blog that could be as potentially inaccurate as the wikipedia article.

Ultimately, <strong>do not</strong> use wikipedia as your sole source of information, but <strong>do</strong> use it as a springboard to find the real dirt.
