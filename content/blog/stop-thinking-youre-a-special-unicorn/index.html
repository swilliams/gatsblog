<p><a href="http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer">This image</a> has been circling the Internet recently. It demonstrates the peril of interrupting a programmer deep in thought: they lose their focus and can't immediately jump back to where it was.</p>

<p>While this is definitely true, it is also true for every single other job that requires critical thought or analysis. Which is just about anything more complex than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i5OrcxwFUA">ditch digging</a>.</p>

<p>I believe that one of the roots of the evils<sup>1</sup> in software development right now stems from pride. The notion that you're inherently better just because you can string together a couple of while loops and use the Terminal is ridiculous.</p>

<p><small>1. Sexism, elitism, and general douche-baginess.</small></p>
